    <h2>What is <i>recycling?</i></h2>
    <p><span style="color: green; font-weight: normal;">Recycling</span> is the reusing of materials that have already been utilized. People have been recycling since ancient times, although, recently recycling has become a greater part of daily life. This is because of the increasing cost of solids, the diminishing of natural recources and the growing pollution of the world. 
      <br>
Some gardeners use biodegradable, organic kitchen foods as soil, and in doing so recycle their own materials. There are many ways that reusing materials can be introduced into daily life and also make the world a cleaner place.</p>

    <h2>There are two types of recycling operations:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Internal Recycling</li>
         <ul>
	   <li>An industry reclaims materials that were waster from another manufacturing process</li>
	   <li>The materials are reused in the same process</li>
	   <li>An example of this is a factory line that cycles through extra materials</li>
	 </ul>
      <li>External Recycling</l1>
         <ul>
	   <li>Materials are collected from an object that is no longer useable or functioning</li>
	   <li>Those materials are reclaimed</li>
	   <li>An example of this is using old newspapers for the creation of newsprint</li>
	 </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>WASTE</h2>
    <p>In the US, every year, more than 200 million pounds of waste are generated each year. To put that into prespective, 200 million seconds is the same as 3.82 <i>years.</i> That is a lot of waste, only from the United States. This leads to 4.5 pounds per person each day.</p>
