    <p>The first step in the three Rs is <span style="color: green;">reduce,</span> if the waste each person makes one day decreases,less waste will needed to be sent to the landfill. There are many small ways that the amount of materials that one uses each day can be decreased.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not use materials or items that are not needed</li>
      <li>If you need to use something, try to use it again; like a reuseable waterbottle</li>
      <li>Try not to make as much waste when eating, serve small portions and always go back for more if needed</li>
      <li>Don't let the water run longer while doing dishes, brushing teeth, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col col2 row4">
    <h2 class="slide_left">REUSE</h2>
    <p>After the amount of waste that is normally created has been decreased; it is important to reuse that which cannot be reduced. Donation is a huge way to help the environemt, and other people. Something that you may not need could be treasure for someone else.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Donate items that are no longer needed</li>
      <li>Buy re-useable products: such as water bottles, ziplock containers, etc.</li>
      <li>Use school/work supplies every year: there is no need to buy new ones unless they are no longer functional</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Paper makes of 25% of solid waste per year in the US alone: this number can be reduced by looking for a paper recycling bag near your home, school or office and putting your paper waste there</li>
      <li>Around 35 million tons of plastic waste are produced in the US, Plastics can also be recycled in community bins</li>
      <li>Electronics & batteres can also be recycled. Some stores and buildings have special recycling bins dedicated to these products because they must be taken care of seperately</li>
